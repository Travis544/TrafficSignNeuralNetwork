# TrafficSignNeuralNetwork
  - The traffic.py script creates and train a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow to identify which traffic sign appears in a photo.
    - Usage: python traffic.py data_directory model_name
      - data_directory is the directory of the data, and model_name is the name of the output model
  - The prediction.py script shows how to load the a trained model and run prediction on it.
  - The dataset is from (https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news)
